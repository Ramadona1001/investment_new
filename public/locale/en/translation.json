  "about_msg": "The group was founded in 2011 and its business began to grow rapidly. In 2017, coinciding with the launch of the Saudi Vision 2030 projects, we restructured and developed the group, setting new and innovative strategic and operational plans to adapt to the fundamental changes aimed by the Vision. We adopted the Vision as a guideline in crafting our plans and strengthening our investment expansion. Concurrently with the successive successes of the Vision, and its transformation into a tangible reality that we experience and benefit from day by day, we have been implementing our plans with confident and precise steps.",
  "about_msg_2": "In line with the above, the group's focus on investing in the healthcare sector proved successful through the operation of hospitals and specialized medical and social centers. The remarkable success achieved led to expansion into real estate development and contracting, taking advantage of the qualitative leap provided by the Vision since 2017. The group has kept the new national legislations in mind, considering them a key partner in its successes. Building on these achievements, the group continuously plans to compete both locally and globally, having made the ambitious Vision, which reaches for the skies, the limit of its aspirations.",
